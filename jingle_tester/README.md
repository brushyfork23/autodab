# Jingle Tester

Use this sketch to test out the ready-to-hit jingle.  

## Usage

Play with the numeric values in the block of 8 `#define` statements at the top to adjust the pitch and length of each note, and the delay between the notes.  Upload this sketch to the autodab rig and press the **GO** button to hear it.

## Applying changes

When you're happy with the jingle, copy the block of 8 `#define` statements to the "`Jingle tones and timings`" section in [autodab_controller.ino](../autodab_controller/autodab_controller.ino).
